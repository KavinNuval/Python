# Python
This is a simple calculator program that runs in the terminal. It allows the user to:
Enter two numbers.
Choose a mathematical operation like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), or modulus (%).
The program then performs the selected operation and displays the result.
After showing the answer, the program asks the user if they want to do another calculation.
      If the user just presses Enter, it repeats the process.
      If the user types exit, the program ends.
Itâ€™s a looped calculator that keeps running until the user decides to quit.
